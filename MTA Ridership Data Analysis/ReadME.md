This is a Data Analysis Challenge Hosted by Maven Analytics.
This project consits of dataset  that represent the rise and decline in the Riderships of each transport medium during pre pandamic, pandameic and post pandemic times.

## Data Context 
This dataset is classified as historic transportation data that has been collected over the timespan of 2020 - 2024, covering various transport services in teh metropolitan areas.It falls under time series
data related to urban mobility and public transit usage.
The data highlights the impact of a global event (the COVID-19 pandemic) on public transportation, showcasing recovery trends over several years.
## Observations 
# General Trends Across Modes of Transport:

1) Ridership across all modes of public transport (subways, buses, LIRR, Metro-North, and Staten Island Railway) shows a significant decline in 2020, which can be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic.
2) Following 2020, there is a consistent recovery in ridership for each subsequent year, reflecting a gradual return to normalcy and increased public movement as restrictions eased.
# Detailed Observations by Transport Type:
1) **Subways and Buses:** Both saw a sharp dip in 2020 but rebounded steadily each year. By 2024, the ridership levels appear close to or have fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels.
2) **LIRR (Long Island Rail Road) and Metro-North:** These show a similar pattern with a notable drop in 2020, followed by steady growth in the following years. By 2024, ridership is nearly consistent, suggesting adaptation and restored trust in these services.
3) **Access-A-Ride Services:** The number of scheduled trips decreased in 2020 but has shown a stable recovery trend similar to other services.
4) **Bridges and Tunnels Traffic:** Unlike public transport, bridges and tunnels maintained a relatively higher traffic level in 2020, possibly due to increased use of personal vehicles during the pandemic.
5) **Staten Island Railway:** The trend reflects patterns similar to other railway services, with a significant drop in 2020 and consistent growth in subsequent years.
## Recommendations:
1) **Resilience Planning:**
Public transport authorities can use these insights to develop better strategies for dealing with similar disruptions in the future. Enhancing flexibility in operations and services can help maintain higher service levels during crises.
2) **Investment in Public Trust and Safety:**
Efforts to improve safety measures, hygiene standards, and public confidence in public transit should continue. This can ensure ridership continues to increase, even during potential future health concerns.
3) **Diversification and Infrastructure Improvements:**
Investing in robust infrastructure for both public transit and alternative transportation (such as cycling and electric vehicles) may help sustain traffic flow without over-relying on any single mode of transport.
