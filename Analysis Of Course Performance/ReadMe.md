# Project Overview
This project is analysis an Ed-tech organisation which provides mulitple online courses in categories Maths,Science,Physical Eduaction, History and many more. 
Stakeholder asked to analyze the dataset and find out how the courses are perfroming, which coure is more engaging , how learners are responding to the courses 
so that necessasry actions can be taken to improvise the courses for better enagagement, interest and for better reach.
I have used numpy, pandas , matplolib and seabron library to anlayse teh data.
# Insights 
+ Beginner and advanced courses have relatively higher completion rates compared to intermediate courses.
+ Math and Science courses have higher completion rates, while Humanities and Music show lower rates.
+ Courses related to Physical Education and Music attract the highest enrollments, while Math has the least.
+ Courses with 6 and 12 weeks have slightly higher completion rates, while 8-week courses show a lower completion rate.
+ Courses with 3 credits have the highest completion rates, indicating students are more likely to complete medium-credit courses.
# Recomendations
+ This suggests that intermediate courses may require more support to improve student retention and completion rate.
+ We need to take feedbacks from the students enrolled in intermediate courses to find the reasons what is causing the dropouts and less completion rate.
+ Feedback can be based on video content quality, trainers explanation, assessments.
